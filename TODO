* Rewrite the parser
* Separate a module to be loaded as library, without the command-line handling
* Rewrite the engine with either user dictionaries or complete object-like system
* Do a sane and not ad-hoc cache system, especially without so many entropy calculations
  if possible
* Add more examples (maybe translate from the Dada Engine?)
* Study improvements in the language from Lisp languages
