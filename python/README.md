This is a Python version of the Tzara Engine, wrote as a prototype before the JavaScript version. It is not directly compatible with either the original Dada Engine, nor with the JavaScript version, and the code is somewhat convoluted. Still, I've kept it because people might find useful a pure Python implementation of the Dada Engine, especially given that the cache system tries to guarantee not to have two subsequent, identical rule generations whenever possible.
